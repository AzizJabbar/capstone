# NutrieCare - Mealplanner Chatbot

### Overview
We wanted to make chatbot app that can help people deciding their meal based on nutrition they are needed. We used Multiclassification model machine learning to give a list of recommended food items based on user RDA/AKG left after eating a meal. Also for our smart chatbot, we are using NLP to classify the given message to a specific label and then the bot will answer that message based on the the label. 

This idea came from indonesian people daily life especially college students that have a mindset eating is all about getting full, while ignoring their nutrition needs. So there is a lot of malnutrition and excess nutrition problem like stunting growth and obesity. With the help of this app hopefully it can tackle these problem little by little.
